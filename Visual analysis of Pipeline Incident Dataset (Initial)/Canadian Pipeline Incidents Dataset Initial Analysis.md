# Pipeline Incidents Dataset Analysis


## Analytics queries or questions:
● How many fatal or serious injury incidents were reported in the last 5 years?
● Did the number of fatal incidents decrease over the years?
● Which province has the highest number of fire incidents?
● Which is the most common type of incident reported?


## Insights from the dataset:
● NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. company has the largest number of fire incidents
(110 incidents). And almost two-thirds of them have taken place in Alberta.
● Natural Gas - Sweet is the most commonly released substance (with 500
occurrences) during a pipeline incident. And the majority of these substance
releases of Natural Gas - Sweet happened in Alberta (with 175 cases).
● Almost two-thirds(1151) of the incidents happened during the operation of the
pipeline.
● Out of 100 fatal or serious injury incidents, 72 happened during construction. And
most of the construction incidents (45 cases) happened in the last 5 years.


## Process of analysis:
I used the spreadsheet application to explore and analyze the pipeline incident’s data. I
manually filtered the columns based on categories (like Incident types, activity, province,
and company) using the filter tool and sorted the values to answer the basic queries. I
used some functions in the spreadsheet and did many manual analyses to derive
insights from the data. I used functions such as COUNTIF and COUNTIFS.


## Challenges:
I faced two challenges when I analyzed this dataset. The first challenge was dealing with
multiple incident types for a record. It was harder than expected to categorize them. The
second challenge was dealing with non-relevant values in the ‘Nearest Populated
Centre’ column. Some records had numeric values instead of place names. It could have
been a human error during data entry. It was time-consuming to find the name of the
places with respect to their latitude and longitude values manually.
